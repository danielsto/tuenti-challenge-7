## Introduction
This is my approach to the programming contest Tuenti Challenge 7 organized by Tuenti in 2017.
Most of the code was written in Python 3.5 and is available in this repository.
There are also files containing input and output data for each challenge.

I had some problems submitting a couple of output files so I was not properly ranked
(I sent output from one challenge to two different challenges). Nevertheless I was #327 out of 1428 contestants.
 
 More on my experience in this [blog post]() in spanish.

## Challenge 1 - Pizza Love
Only modules from The Python Standard Library were used to solve this challenge.
These modules were [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) for mathematical functions
and [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) to interact with the operating system.

This one was pretty easy. Details can be found [here](https://contest.tuenti.net/Challenges). For each case in the input file, 
pizzas slices were added to a total which then was divided by 8 (number of slices per 
pizza). Then math.ceil() function was applied to that sum so that there was enough pizza 
for everyone, even though this may cause some leftovers.

Run time: ~0.07 seconds including file reading and writing.  
Number of lines: 17 including module imports. Main algorithm is 8 lines.
## Challenge 2 - Bowling
Only one module from The Python Standard Library was used to solve this challenge.
This module was [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) to enable interaction
with the operating system.

This one was a little bit more tricky because I had no idea how bowling was scored.
